## Why I made this

- The windows client is finicky
- 3 to 5 FPS with LCD popping/strobing effects are very hard to look at... I personally really struggle with motion sickness from it.
- The art assets make heavy use of dithering that looked great on small CRTs but look entirely different (and unpleasant) on modern displays without filtering.
- The game window not resizeable (547×540) and didn't look good or fit well on most screens even with OS/VM scaling
- Quicktime MIDI is dead on modern OS X
- Quicktime for Windows is unsupported past Windows 7 (last updated 2009) and is a real security risk
- A number of security concerns with the old client
- All existing (functioning) clients are single-platform and closed-source
- Input schemes are odd or outdated
- Macros seem to be manitory to keep up. Most available are ancient, difficult to find and require fiddling in a odd macro language

## What does goThoom offer?

- Optional Interpolation for smooth movement at any frame-rate with a trade-off of more positional latency (animations and sounds are unaffected)
- Texture processing that intelligently smooths dithering to restore a more CRT-like look to revive lurking color information and reduce popping/strobing effects when moving
- Animation frame blending for a far smoother and pleasant experience that helps the existing animations look their best
- High quality adjustable game window resizing that retains sharpness with very little artifacts
- High quality audio resampling that is very flattering to the original recordings and more pleasant to the ear
* Resampling: (1024-Phase 8192-Tap Lanczos Windowed-Sinc),
* Bit depth conversion: TPDF noise shaping with 257 scaling for the best 8-bit to 16-bit conversion possible
- Much higher quality music synthisizer that is more flexible (currently uses a 309MB soundfont file) that is not tied to a dead dependency.
- Built-in local AI text-to-speech with a large choice of voices available online
- Text rendering is anti-aliased and uses high quality modern fonts via OpenType and fractional font sizes are supported
- Many-platform support: Windows, OS X, Linux and others are possible
- Dark mode, light mode or fun colorful themes (even create your own)
- Modern APIs: DirectX on Windows, Metal on OS X and Vulkan via Zink on Linux and even supports software rendering.
* Use of Metal API is important because OpenGL support has been deprecated for ages on OS X and will be stuck at v4.1 and eventually removed.
- Self-contained portable binary, no installers or external dependencies
- Open-source and public domain to prevent it becoming unmaintained abandonware
- Full Clan Lord client macro system: file-based macros with expressions, replacements, key/click/function macros, variables, flow control (goto, if/else-if/else, random), timing (pause/timingk/atimek), and env settings. Drop-in compatible with existing macro files.
- Powerful scripting system using a common language, meaning most users will be able to seek support from LLMs.
- Choices for more modern input schemes like enter-to-talk, WASD and use of non-fkeys
* Modern laptops often do not support touchpad + keyboard simultaneously (palm rejection)
* Many modern PCs only have 'media keys' and require you use a function key or mode switch to use. Some only offer touch-screen F-Keys or even no F-Keys at all!

## Download
**Easiest:** grab the latest build from **Releases** on this repo (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Quick start
- On first run, the client **auto-fetches missing game assets** (images, sounds) into `data/`. No manual wrangling.

### Optional extras
- **Background and splash images** – place `background.png` and/or `splash.png` in `data/` to override the default visuals.
- **Sound font** – drop a `soundfont.sf2` file into `data/` to change the music instrument set. The Download Files window can fetch a suitable one.
- **TTS voices** – voice archives (`.tar.gz`) or `.onnx` models with matching `.onnx.json` configs belong in `data/piper/voices`. Use `build-scripts/download_piper.sh` or the Download Files window to grab voices from online collections.

### Custom themes and styles
Themes live in `themes/palettes` and styles in `themes/styles`. On first run the client writes an `Example.json` palette and style plus a README explaining the format. Copy these files, adjust the colors or geometry, and select your new theme in Settings. With `eui.AutoReload = true` changes on disk are picked up automatically.

### Text-to-speech voices
Piper voices are stored in `data/piper/voices`. The client and `build-scripts/download_piper.sh` support voice archives in `.tar.gz` format and automatically extract and remove the archives. If a voice archive isn't available, the program falls back to downloading raw `.onnx` models with matching `.onnx.json` configs.

### Downloading TTS files and soundfonts
Use the **Download Files** window to fetch optional resources. The TTS option downloads the Piper binary and English voices for chat speech, while the soundfont enables higher quality music playback. Both boxes are checked by default and can be unchecked to skip their downloads.

### Low-end hardware
Enable **Potato GPU (low VRAM)** in Settings → Graphics if your system or driver only supports textures up to 4096×4096 pixels (for example, Raspberry Pi or very old GPUs). This mode uses smaller textures to avoid driver issues.

## Using the UI

- Windows: Click the `Windows` toolbar button to toggle common panels: Players, Inventory, Chat, Console, Help, Hotkeys, Shortcuts, Mixer, Settings, and more. Window layout and open/closed state persist between runs.
- Actions: Use the `Actions` toolbar drop-down for Hotkeys, Shortcuts, Triggers, or Scripts. Dedicated buttons provide quick access to Settings, Help, Snapshot, Mixer, and Exit.
- Movement: Left-click to walk, or use WASD/arrow keys (hold Shift to run). An optional "Click-to-Toggle Walk" sets a target with one click.
- Input bar: Press Enter to type; press Enter again to send. Esc cancels. Up/Down browse history. While typing, Ctrl-V pastes and Ctrl-C copies the whole line. Right-click the input bar for Paste / Copy Line / Clear Line (Paste and Clear switch to typing mode and refresh immediately).
- Chat/Console: Chat and Console are separate windows by default. Right-click any chat or console line to copy it; the line briefly highlights. You can merge chat into the console in Settings.
- Inventory: Single-click selects. Double-click equips/unequips; Shift + double-click uses. Right-click an item for a context menu: Equip/Unequip, Examine, Show, Drop, Drop (Mine). If a shortcut is assigned to an item, its key appears like `[Q]` before the name.
- Players: Single-click selects a player. Right-click a name for Thank, Curse, Anon Thank…, Anon Curse…, Share, Unshare, Info, Pull, or Push. Tags in the list: `>` sharing, `<` sharee, `*` same clan.
- Mixer: Adjust Main/Game/Music/TTS volumes and enable/disable channels.
- Quality: Pick a preset, or tweak motion smoothing, denoising, blending.

Tip: The input bar auto-expands as you type and has a context menu for quick paste/copy/clear.

## Scripts

goThoom can load optional scripts at startup using [yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi), a Go interpreter.
Place `.go` files inside the `scripts/` directory.

### Testing server messages

Use the `/testhooks` command to inject fake server messages for debugging or
script development. Run `/testhooks help` to see available message names.

```
/testhooks MESSAGE [NAME] DATA
```

`MESSAGE` is a server message name like `share` or `info`. Supply `NAME`
for messages referencing a mobile, and put the message body in `DATA`. Running
`/testhooks` without arguments emits a few sample messages.

Available message types:

| Name | Tag | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| bard | ba | bard message |
| backend | be | back-end command |
| clan | cn | clan name |
| config | cf | config |
| nodisplay | dd | do not display |
| demo | de | demo notice |
| depart | dp | depart |
| download | dl | download |
| error | er | error message |
| gm | gm | game master |
| fallen | hf | has fallen |
| notfallen | nf | no longer fallen |
| info | in | info |
| inventory | iv | inventory |
| karma | ka | karma |
| karmarecv | kr | karma received |
| logoff | lf | log off |
| logon | lg | log on |
| location | lo | location |
| multi | ml | multilingual |
| monster | mn | monster name |
| music | mu | music |
| news | nw | news |
| player | pn | player name |
| share | sh | share |
| unshare | su | unshare |
| textlog | tl | text log only |
| think | th | think |
| mono | tt | monospaced style |
| who | wh | who list |
| youkilled | yk | you killed |

### Build with Docker (cross compile capable)

A `Dockerfile` provides a reproducible cross-platform build environment.

```bash
./build-scripts/docker_dev_env.sh
docker create --name gothoom-build gothoom-build-env
mkdir -p dist
docker cp gothoom-build:/out ./dist
docker rm gothoom-build
```

The `dist/` directory will contain the compiled binaries.
See [`docs/Docker.md`](docs/Docker.md) for details.
